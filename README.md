# EntityFinalProject
This is a data science project that required us to pick a dataset to work from and explore.
We were tasked with creating a project proposal asking leading question about our data. After
asking questions we would use some analysis techniques we were taugh in the course on our data
to answer those questions.

## Project questions
1. Which game has the most playtime?
2. Which genre has the most playtime?
3. Can we create a recommender system based on the information?
4. What is the difference in playtime between action, sports, and shooter games

## Project Analysis Techniques
- Statitical Ananlysis
- One Way ANOVA
- Recommender System
